This directory contains all source code used for analyses in the paper
"A Computational Theory of Child Overextension",
as well as intermediate data files that are sufficient for data
analyses. For a complete reproduction from raw files, some datasets that come
from independent studies need to be obtained separately; see below.

The code is organized as follows:

    src/:          shared library files
    analyses/:     data analysis code
    scripts/:      source files used mostly for preprocessing raw data
    data/:         data files used in analyses
    intermediate/: data files in intermediate/cached format used in analyses
    results/:      cached results directory
    plots/:        saved plots directory

The Makefile contains rules for all steps. Helpful rules are 'analyses'
and 'plots', which use intermediate data files to reproduce all analyses
in the paper. Thus, a complete replication can be run as follows:

    export PYTHONPATH=src
    make analyses
    make plots

Note that due to cross-validated analyses in the production experiment,
the full process can take several hours. Alternatively, you can look in
the Makefile and run individual analyses one by one.

Python dependencies should be present in most scientific distributions, and
include:

    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scipy
    statsmodels
    torch (with CUDA support)
    nltk (with WordNet package)

    PIL (for full preprocessing only)
    skimage (for full preprocessing only)
    PyLangAcq (for full preprocessing only)

For a full reproduction from raw data, additional datasets to be placed
under data/ are:

    CHILDES transcripts from https://childes.talkbank.org,
    see intermediate/childes_transcripts_used.csv for a list of files.

    ImageNet database from http://image-net.org,
    see intermediate/image-paths/* for the lists of files needed.

    Wordbank vocabulary from http://wordbank.stanford.edu

    Data association from the Small World of Words project, see
    https://smallworldofwords.org/en,
    namely the "random walks" embeddings matrix.
