This project contains replication code, demo notebook, and meta dataset
that accompany the paper:

Ferreira Pinto, R., Jr., & Xu, Y. (2019). A Computational Theory of Child
Overextension. Manuscript submitted for publication.

The directories are organized as follows:

    code/: all code and intermediate data files necessary for replication of
    the analyses in the paper

    dataset/: meta dataset of overextension noun-referent pairs

    demo/: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the proposed computational framework
    demo.zip: zip file containing the demo only.

Each directory contains a README file further documenting how to use each
resource.
